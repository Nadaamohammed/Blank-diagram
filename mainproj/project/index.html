                 <h3>Cathedral of Our Lady of Africa</h3>
                 <p>On the rocky coast of the Mediterranean Sea, at a height of 124 meters rises the main religious landmark of Algeria - the Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Africa. There is a popular belief that the idea of erecting the temple came to two Lyon residents who once installed a small sculpture of the Virgin Mary in the hollow of an olive tree here. The cathedral itself, erected in 1872, is designed in an architectural style combining Roman and Byzantine motifs.</p>

                 <h3>Qetshawa Mosque</h3>
                 <p>n the heart of the capital city of Algiers sits the medieval Ketshawa Mosque, which is considered one of the most notable architectural structures in the city. Built by the Turks in 1612, Ketshawa is an unusual mixture of Byzantine and Moorish styles, and over the years it has changed its appearance several times. During the French occupation it was the Catholic cathedral of St. Philip, and it was not until 1962 that the building was converted to a mosque.</p>

                    <p>The ruins of the lost ancient Roman city of Timgad date back some 2,000 years.
